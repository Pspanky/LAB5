The only thing that I need to talk about here is that I still have the same edit problem from my last lab. I assumed that I didn't need to change this as I successfully transferred the back ednd support of my lab to mongodb stuff. Hope that's ok!

To clarify, the bug is that when you edit the content in one of the post, you need to click the "Done" button twice before the edit appears. Idk why
